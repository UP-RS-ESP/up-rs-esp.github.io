Satellites carrying synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrumentation are providing novel and exciting opporutnities to perform geomorphological analysis from space-bourn observations. In our recent paper [**Applications of SAR interferometric coherence time series: Spatiotemporal dynamics of geomorphic transitions in the south‐central Andes**](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JF005141), we exploit [ESA/Copernicus's Sentinel-1](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1) C-band SAR images to characterize geomorphic activity in the Central Andes of northwestern Argentina. We create a 4 year time-series of surface change from the coherence between SAR images taken 2-4 weeks apart, then calculate the average pattern of geomorphic chagne over these four years. Using the average coherence for the arid and semi-arid regions of our study area, we are able to estimate the transition between geomorphic/sediment transport domains (e.g., between areas dominated by gravity-driven hillslope erosion and by erosion from fluvial incision).

Additionally, across regional rainfall and vegetation gradients, we observe a positive correlation between 10-Beryllium terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide derived basin-wide erosion rates and the basin-wise range of cohrence values. There is also a positive correlation between basin-wise coherence range and topometric proxies of longterm uplift and erosion (e.g., channel steepness). Our study suggests that a dense time series of interferometric coherence can be used as a proxy for surface sediment movement and landscape stability in vegetation‐free settings at event to decadal timescales.
