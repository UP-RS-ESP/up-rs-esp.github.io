The most presumed causes of reduction in observed reduction in air pollution are reduction in surface traffic and people staying at home due to the travel bans imposed. In this analysis changes of NO<sub>2</sub> and CO emissions are compared against the three variables:

- The average population in Europe
- Road density in Europe
- Vessel routes density in the Mediterranean Sea and the black sea

This research was suppervised by Prof. Dr. Bodo Bookhagen and Dr. Taylor Smith.
