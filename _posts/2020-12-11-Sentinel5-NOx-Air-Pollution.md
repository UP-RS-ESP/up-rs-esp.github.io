The most presumed causes of reduction in observed reduction in air pollution are reduction in surface traffic and people staying at home due to the travel bans imposed. In this analysis changes of NO<sub>2</sub> and CO emissions are compared against the three variables:

- The average population in Europe
- Road density in Europe
- Vessel routes density in the Mediterranean Sea and the black sea



### Key takeaways


- Road traffic reduction has been the primary cause of the reduction in NO<sub>2</sub> emissions during the lock-down period in Europe.

- The places that have higher drops in NO<sub>2</sub> volumes during the confinement period have higher road, vessel and population densities.

- Road, vessel and population density data do not provide strong reasoning for the reduction in CO emissions due to two reasons:

	1. CO is a highly dispersing gas, and therefore, it might not be a good approach to compare the geographical location of the sensed CO gas and its sources

	1. People staying at home during lock-down could have created events that have both positive and negative effects on changes in CO emission levels.

- It would add further insights to this analysis if the locations of the industries that contribute to a high level of NO<sub>2</sub> and CO emissions in Europe could be checked against the changes in CO and NO<sub>2</sub> emission levels in these locations during the lock-down period because 50% of the CO emissions and 8% of NO<sub>2</sub> emissions are coming from commercial
institutions.
