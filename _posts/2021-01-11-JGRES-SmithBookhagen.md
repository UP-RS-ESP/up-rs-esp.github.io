Neighboring terrain facing in different directions is not equally steep. This effect is caused by the complex interactions of geology, tectonics, vegetation, climate, and precipitation. Small differences in erosion processes lead to subtle variations in topographic form at the global scale.

In general:

* Steep terrain has more unequal slopes
* Pole-facing terrain is on average steeper than equator-facing terrain
* High-elevation and low-temperature regions tend to have terrain steepened towards the equator

# Global Topographic Asymmetry Magnitudes

We first divide the globe into a set of 0.25&deg; boxes. Using those boxes as our analysis unit, we can calculate the average slope at each 1&deg; aspect bin (e.g., the average slope facing in each unique direction). From this, we can calculate the center point of each slope-aspect distribution, which measures how north-south and east-west steepened a given area is. This leads to our first result -- a global map of north-south topographic asymmetry.

There is a clear pattern of steepening reversal at the equator -- terrain facing towards the poles is almost universally steeper. This pattern somewhat -- but not completely -- mirrors differences in received solar radiation: those slopes facing towards the equator will receive more sunlight over the course of the year. Hence, in general, slopes which receive less solar radiation are steeper.

The next question, then, is what is driving the development of this topographic asymmetry?


# Implications and Takeaways

In vegetated landscapes, higher vegetation cover on pole-facing terrain encourages resistance to erosion by overland flow and diffusion. Hence, equator-facing slopes exhibit higher erosion rates where -- all else being equal -- diffusive and advective processes are more effective and generally result in shallower slopes. This is supported by the strong north-south vegetation density asymmetry observed at a global scale, and by the relatively stronger north-south topographic asymmetry signal observed in wet areas, where vegetation asymmetries are higher. Mid-latitude topographic asymmetry is relatively higher due to insolation controls on the magnitude of vegetation asymmetries; lower topographic asymmetry at high latitudes and around the equator partially reflects relatively low vegetation asymmetries.

In high elevation and cold environments, a different set of erosion processes play a role in the development of topographic asymmetry. Periglacial processes can encourage equator-steepening of topography via intense erosion on pole-facing slopes and headwall retreat. Pole-facing terrain in extremely cold environments remains frozen and stable for more of the year -- indeed, in permafrost landscapes, the differences in temperature amplitude between pole- and equator-facing slopes can be quite large. Freeze-thaw cycling also acts more forcefully on equator-facing slopes, primarily through enhancing solifluction, slumping, and modifying soil-water penetration and overland flow. In high-relief and tectonically active environments, hillslope-transport processes will thus remove more material on equator-facing slopes. Where material transport is high, for example in steep river valleys, this material may not lead to gentler slopes at higher erosion rates. Even where material transport is low, slumping and mass movement could lead to terrain with steep upper sections and shallow lower sections rather than a more gradual and smooth hillslope form as is typical in mid-latitude regions.


**The key points to remember are that:**

* Steep terrain has more unequal slopes
* Terrain facing towards the poles supports more vegetation, and is generally steeper
* Low temperature regions often have steeper slopes facing the equator, where they receive more solar radiation
